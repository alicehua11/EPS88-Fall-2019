    "To electrify more of the electric grid and transportation, more metals are being mined. Batteries are driving a particular demond for cobalt as lithium-ion batteries utilize a chemical reaction between lithium and cobalt oxide. There are major problems with the current cobolt supply particularly with there being small-scale mines that are unregulated with regard to safety, child labor and environmental impact. Watch this video to learn more:\n",

    "**Your task in this assignment is to track down what types of igneous rocks have the most cobalt (Co) by completing the following assessments**\n",

    "1) The lowest grade of ore that is mined for cobalt is 0.01%. How many data points have concentrations of cobalt that might be this high (recall that the data are in ppm).\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Compare the distributions of cobalt in the COMPOSITION categories of 'FELSIC', 'INTERMEDIATE', 'MAFIC', 'ULTRAMAFIC' using both probability density estimates and box-plots. For the box plot, I recommend using `sns.boxenplot` and setting the ylim so it is zoomed in on the boxes. Answer this question, if you were going to target one of these compositions for mineral exploration, which one would you target?\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Let's say you needed to make a choice whether to explore in mafic intrusive (plutonic) rocks or mafic volcanics rocks. The coarser-grained plutonic rocks that crystallized underground have the 'PLUTONIC' label in the 'TYPE' column while the volcanic rocks have the 'VOLCANIC' label. Use the A/B test framework and determine whether both the mean and the median are statistically distinct from that which would result from random permutations. Describe the results of your test in a paragraph that demonstrates that you understand what the test is and what the results (including calculated p-values) mean.
